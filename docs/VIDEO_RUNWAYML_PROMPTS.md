frame, ultra clean UI/UX design, modern sans-serif typography
```

**Camera Movement:** Slow push-in on the dashboard  
**Duration:** 5 seconds  
**Export:** 1080p, 24fps

**Alternative Approach:**
1. Design the dashboard in Figma (I can provide specs)
2. Export as static image
3. Use RunwayML image-to-video with this prompt:
   ```
   Camera slowly pushes in on the dashboard screen, location pins appear 
   one by one on the map, numbers in the stats panel count upward, 
   subtle UI animations, professional and smooth, modern SaaS aesthetic
   ```

**Production Note:**
This is complex for AI generation. Better approach:
1. Record screen capture of a prototype/mockup
2. OR design in Figma with Auto-Animate
3. OR use RunwayML for the background, add UI elements in After Effects

**Text Overlay (add in editing):**
- Bottom: "No app required. Just works." (appears at 19s)

## 🎨 Additional Generation Tips for RunwayML

### General Settings:
- **Model:** Gen-3 Alpha Turbo (faster, good quality)
- **Duration:** 5-10 seconds per clip
- **Resolution:** 1280x768 (upscale to 1080p in post)
- **Seed:** Save seed for consistent style across shots
- **Style Reference:** Use your first successful generation as reference for subsequent shots

### Prompt Modifiers to Add:
For ALL prompts, you can append:
```
, professional commercial quality, 8K, sharp focus, perfect lighting, 
award-winning cinematography, ultra-realistic
```

### For UI/Dashboard Shots:
Since RunwayML struggles with precise UI, consider:
1. **Hybrid approach:** Design UI in Figma → Export → RunwayML image-to-video
2. **Focus on backgrounds:** Generate the environment, add UI in After Effects
3. **Abstract data viz:** Generate abstract data visualizations, composite later

---

## 🎬 Alternative Prompts (If First Attempts Don't Work)

### Shot 1 Alternative (More Abstract):
```
Montage sequence of a person in navy sports jersey in different locations: 
coffee shop, walking outside, gym interior, all within 3 seconds, fast cuts, 
modern lifestyle aesthetic, cinematic color grading, professional commercial
```

### Shot 3 Alternative (Simpler):
```
Overhead shot of iPhone placed gently on navy athletic jersey, soft contact, 
screen lights up, clean minimal background, professional product photography
```

### Shot 7 Alternative (Simpler):
```
Dark navy background with two large numbers appearing sequentially: "2.8×" 
then "4.3×", glowing aqua color, modern typography, minimalist motion design
```

## 🔧 Post-Production Assembly (After RunwayML)

### Software: Premiere Pro, Final Cut, or DaVinci Resolve

**Timeline:**
1. Import all RunwayML-generated clips
2. Trim to exact durations (see shot list)
3. Add transitions (1-frame cuts or quick dissolves)
4. Add text overlays with animations
5. Color grade for consistency (match navy/aqua palette)
6. Add music track
7. Add sound effects
8. Export: 1080p, H.264, 8-10 Mbps

### Color Grading:
- **Shadows:** Slightly lifted (not pure black)
- **Highlights:** Preserve aqua (#33BECC) and coral (#FF6B6B)
- **Overall:** Slightly desaturated for professional B2B feel
- **Consistency:** Match all clips to same color space

## ⚡ Quick Start Workflow

1. **Generate Background/Environment Shots First:**
   - Shot 1 (fan in coffee shop)
   - Shot 8 (jersey product shot)
   - These establish visual style

2. **Use First Successful Shot as Style Reference:**
   - In RunwayML, use "Style Reference" feature
   - Maintains consistent look across all shots

3. **Generate Simple Shots Next:**
   - Shot 2 (calendar)
   - Shot 7 (stats graph)

4. **Complex Shots Last (or hybrid approach):**
   - Shot 3-4 (phone interaction) - may need Figma + RunwayML
   - Shot 5-6 (dashboard) - may need screen recording + effects

5. **Assemble in Editing Software:**
   - Add text overlays
   - Add music
   - Color grade
   - Export

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

**Total Generation Time:** 2-4 hours (including iterations)  
**Total Edit Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Final Video:** 30 seconds, professional B2B quality

**Quality Level:** TV commercial / high-end SaaS product video

## 💡 Pro Tips for RunwayML

1. **Generate longer clips (10s) and trim** - gives editing flexibility
2. **Generate multiple variations** - different camera angles/movements
3. **Save seeds** - consistency across shots
4. **Upscale in post** - RunwayML → Topaz Video AI for 4K
