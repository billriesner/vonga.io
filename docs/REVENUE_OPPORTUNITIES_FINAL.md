# Revenue Opportunities Section - Final Configuration

**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Adjustment:** Swapped Repeat Commerce → Location-Aware Commerce  
**Status:** ✅ **LIVE**

---

## ✅ Final 4 Cards (2×2 Grid)

### Card Order

1. **Location-Aware Commerce** (geofencing capability)
2. **Sponsor Revenue Platform** (sponsor monetization)
3. **Peak Moment Revenue** (event-triggered)
4. **Year-Round Engagement** (content/retention)

---

## 🔄 What Changed (Final Adjustment)

### Removed: Repeat Commerce Channel
**Why:** Redundant with overall site message
- Site already emphasizes ongoing revenue, repeat purchases
- Hero, Problem, Category sections all cover this
- Dedicating a card to it was repetitive

### Added Back: Location-Aware Commerce
**Why:** Unique capability that deserves representation
- Geofencing IS an important differentiator
- Not the ONLY thing, but one of four core capabilities
- Balanced approach: 1 of 4 cards (25%), not 1 of 1 (100%)

---

## 🎯 Strategic Balance Achieved

### Before First Redesign (Over-Emphasized)
- ❌ Location-Aware Commerce = First card
- ❌ Section focus = 40%+ on geofencing
- ❌ Message: "Vonga = geofencing platform"

### After First Redesign (Too Far)
- ❌ No geofencing card at all
- ❌ Repeat Commerce card (redundant with site message)
- ❌ Downplayed important capability

### Final (Balanced) ✅
- ✅ Location-Aware Commerce = One of four cards
- ✅ Section focus = 25% on geofencing (balanced)
- ✅ Message: "Vonga has 4 core revenue capabilities, geofencing is one"

- Not over-emphasized, not omitted
- Equal visual weight with other capabilities

### 2. Removed Redundancy ✅
- Repeat Commerce covered elsewhere:
  - Hero: "Make apparel a year-round engagement channel"
  - Problem: "Turn year-round engagement into year-round revenue"
  - Category: "Ongoing revenue" message
- No need to repeat in this section

### 3. Shows Full Breadth ✅

Four distinct dimensions of revenue growth

### Individual Card Messages
