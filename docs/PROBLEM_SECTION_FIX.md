# Problem Section - Fix Engagement vs Wearing Confusion

**Issue:** Current copy conflates "wearing an item" with "engaging with the team"

**Research Fact (Verified):**
- 47% of fans engage multiple times weekly
- = 100+ **touchpoints** per year (checking scores, watching games, social media, etc.)
- NOT wearing the same item 100+ times

## Current Copy (INCORRECT)

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "You sell a $60 kit. Fans wear it 100+ times. You earn revenue once. 80% of teams face this problem. Merch revenue happens at a few events. Fans engage year-round. That gap is your opportunity.",
  statement: "Start earning revenue every time fans wear your kit."
}
```

**Issue:** "Fans wear it 100+ times" is not factually accurate

---

## Recommended Fix Options

### Option 1: Focus on Engagement Frequency (Most Accurate)

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "Fans engage with your team 100+ times per year. Revenue happens at 3-5 events. That gap is your opportunity.",
  statement: "Turn year-round engagement into year-round revenue."
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Factually accurate (100+ touchpoints)
- ✅ Clear gap (100+ vs 3-5)
- ✅ Concise (14 words)
- ✅ Sets up solution

**Words:** 14

---

### Option 2: Use Research Language Directly

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "Nearly half of fans engage multiple times per week. But merch revenue happens at a few events per year. That's 100+ engagement moments with revenue captured at 3-5.",
  statement: "Close the gap. Turn engagement into revenue."
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Uses verified research language
- ✅ Quantifies the gap clearly
- ✅ "100+ engagement moments" = accurate

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Longer (25 words)

**Words:** 25

---

### Option 3: Simplified Gap Focus

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "Fans engage year-round. Revenue happens at events. Most teams only capture revenue 3-5 times per year while fans show up 100+ times.",
  statement: "Make engagement generate revenue."
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clear problem statement
- ✅ Quantifies gap
- ✅ "Show up" = broad (attend, watch, engage)

**Words:** 22

---

### Option 4: Transaction vs Engagement

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "You sell a $60 kit once. Fans engage with your team 100+ times that year. You earn revenue at checkout, then nothing.",
  statement: "Turn one transaction into ongoing revenue."
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Keeps transaction framing ($60 kit)
- ✅ Accurate (engage 100+ times)
- ✅ Clear contrast (once vs 100+)

**Words:** 19

---

### Option 5: Ultra-Concise (From Research Doc)

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "Your fans show up 100+ times per year. Revenue happens at 3-5 events. That gap is the opportunity.",
  statement: "Close the gap."
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simplest (16 words)
- ✅ "Show up" = broad term (includes wearing, but not exclusively)
- ✅ Clear gap math

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Loses $60 transaction anchor

**Words:** 16

## My Top Recommendation

### **Option 1: Focus on Engagement Frequency**

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "Fans engage with your team 100+ times per year. Revenue happens at 3-5 events. That gap is your opportunity.",
  statement: "Turn year-round engagement into year-round revenue."
}
```

**Why This Wins:**

1. **Factually Accurate:**
   - ✅ "Engage 100+ times" = verified research
   - ✅ "3-5 events" = conservative estimate
   - ✅ No conflation

2. **Clear Gap:**
   - 100+ vs 3-5 = obvious mismatch
   - "That gap" = the opportunity

3. **Sets Up Solution:**
   - Statement: "Turn year-round engagement into year-round revenue"
   - Connects to Vonga's "year-round engagement channel" positioning

4. **Concise:**
   - 14 words (description)
   - Scannable
   - No fluff

5. **Statement Aligns with Hero:**
   - Hero: "Make apparel a year-round engagement channel"
   - Problem statement: "Turn year-round engagement into year-round revenue"
   - Consistent messaging

## Alternative: Option 5 (Ultra-Concise)

If you prefer "show up" language (which is more casual but accurate):

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "Your fans show up 100+ times per year. Revenue happens at 3-5 events. That gap is the opportunity.",
  statement: "Close the gap."
}
```

**Why This Also Works:**
- ✅ "Show up" = attend, watch, engage, wear (broad)
- ✅ Even more concise (16 words)
- ✅ "Close the gap" = direct CTA

## What About Apparel?

**Question:** Should we mention apparel/wearing at all in the problem section?

**Answer:** We can, but it should be accurate:

### Option 6: Apparel + Engagement (Hybrid)

```typescript
problem: {
  headline: "The Dormant Asset Problem",
  description: "Fans wear your gear and engage with your team 100+ times per year. Revenue happens at 3-5 events. That gap is your opportunity.",
  statement: "Turn every engagement into a revenue opportunity."
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Acknowledges apparel (wearing gear)
- ✅ Accurate about engagement frequency
- ✅ Doesn't claim "wear the same item 100+ times"

**Words:** 20
