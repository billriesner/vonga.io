- ❌ Experience types too detailed/example-heavy

---

## Section-by-Section Analysis

### 1. HERO SECTION

#### Current Copy
**Headline:** "Turn Team Apparel Into a Revenue-Generating Asset" ✅  
**Subhead:** "Vonga makes team kits location-aware. Every time a fan wears your kit (at games, watch parties, sponsor locations), it unlocks offers, experiences, and revenue opportunities. No app required. No QR codes. Permanent, owned, and fully controlled by your team."

**Issues:**
- ❌ **TOO LONG** - 4 sentences, 51 words (ideal: 1-2 sentences, 20-30 words)
- ❌ Buries the lead (location-aware, no app should be main benefit)
- ❌ Lists examples in parentheses (distracting)
- ❌ "Permanent, owned, and fully controlled" is vague corporate speak

**B2B Best Practice Violation:**
- Hero subheads should answer "What is it?" in ONE clear sentence
- Secondary benefits go in bullet points below, not in subhead

**Recommended Fix:**
```
Headline: "Turn Team Apparel Into a Revenue-Generating Asset"
Subhead: "Location-aware kits that unlock revenue every time fans wear them. No app. No QR codes. Just results."
```

**Why Better:**
- 3 sentences, 21 words (vs 51)
- Benefit-first (unlock revenue)
- Mechanism (location-aware)
- Credibility (no app, no QR)
- Punchy ending (just results)

---

### 2. PROBLEM SECTION

#### Current Copy
**Description:** "You sell a $60 kit. The fan wears it 100+ times per year. But after checkout, that kit generates $0 in additional revenue. More than 80% of sports merchandise revenue happens at a handful of live events. Yet nearly half of fans engage with teams multiple times per week, creating 100+ wearing occasions per year."

**Issues:**
- ❌ **TOO MANY STATS** - 4 different numbers ($60, 100+, 80%, half)
- ❌ Repeats "100+ times" concept twice
- ❌ Stat overload = cognitive burden
- ❌ Lacks emotional punch

**B2B Best Practice Violation:**
- Don't overwhelm with numbers (pick 1-2 most compelling)
- Lead with pain, not data
- Make it personal ("you" language)

**Recommended Fix:**
```
Description: "You sell a $60 kit. The fan wears it 100+ times. You earn revenue once. That's the problem."

Statement: "80% of merch revenue happens at a few events. Your fans engage year-round. Close that gap."
```

**Why Better:**
- Shorter (46 words vs 68)
- One powerful stat (80%) instead of four
- Punchy sentences (impact)
- Direct address (you/your)
- Call to action implied (close that gap)

---

### 3. CATEGORY DEFINITION

#### Current Copy
**Explanation:** "Most teams treat apparel as a product. We treat it as infrastructure. The apparel itself unlocks offers, experiences, and commerce opportunities based on where the fan is and what the team wants to activate."

**Issues:**
- ❌ "Based on where the fan is and what the team wants to activate" = wordy
- ❌ "Infrastructure" is abstract B2B jargon
- ❌ Lists three things (offers, experiences, commerce) = dilutes focus

**B2B Best Practice Violation:**
- Avoid jargon that doesn't add clarity
- Focus on ONE main benefit per sentence
- Use concrete language

**Recommended Fix:**
```
Explanation: "Most teams sell apparel once. We turn it into a revenue channel that works 365 days a year. The kit knows where your fan is and unlocks the right offer at the right time."
```

**Why Better:**
- Concrete benefit (revenue channel, 365 days)
- Explains mechanism simply (knows where, unlocks offer)
- Outcome-focused (not feature-focused)

---

### 4. EXPERIENCE TYPES (Revenue Opportunities)

#### Current Copy (Example)
**Location-Aware Commerce**  
Examples: "Fan at stadium: unlock concession offers. Fan at sponsor location: team earns affiliate revenue. Fan at watch party: exclusive merch drop."

**Issues:**
- ❌ **READS LIKE A LIST** - colon-separated examples
- ❌ Too detailed for a scan (3 scenarios)
- ❌ "Team earns affiliate revenue" = corporate speak
- ❌ No urgency or emotional pull

**B2B Best Practice Violation:**
- B2B buyers scan (they don't read lists)
- Lead with outcome, not scenarios
- Use action verbs

**Recommended Fix:**
```
Examples: "Game day? Unlock concessions. Watch party? Drop exclusive merch. Sponsor location? Earn commission. Every wearing = revenue opportunity."
```

**Why Better:**
- Scannable (4 short bursts)
- Questions create engagement
- Action verbs (unlock, drop, earn)
- Clear pattern (situation → outcome)
- Ends with big idea (every wearing = revenue)

---

### 5. DIY COMPARISON SECTION

#### Current Copy
**Description:** "You could try to piece together a solution with QR codes, a loyalty program, and social media. But that approach has fundamental limitations:"

**Issues:**
- ❌ "Piece together" is weak language
- ❌ "Fundamental limitations" = academic
- ❌ Lacks urgency/punch

**B2B Best Practice Violation:**
- Don't use weak verbs ("try to")
- Avoid academic language ("fundamental limitations")
- Make it punchy

**Recommended Fix:**
```
Description: "Some teams try QR codes, loyalty apps, and social media. Here's why that doesn't work:"
```

**Why Better:**
- Direct (doesn't work vs has limitations)
- Shorter (13 words vs 23)
- Confident tone
- Sets up comparison naturally

---

### 6. PARTNERSHIP SECTION

#### Current Copy
**Points:**
- "Revenue optimization, not just kit production"
- "Location-aware commerce infrastructure included"
- "Design collaboration and hands-on support"
- "Pilot programs: 100-kit minimum, full platform access"
- "Launch in 6-8 weeks from approval"

**Issues:**
- ❌ First point is vague ("optimization")
- ❌ "Location-aware commerce infrastructure" = jargon
- ❌ Lists features without outcomes
- ❌ No urgency

**B2B Best Practice Violation:**
- Features don't sell in B2B (outcomes do)
- Bullet points should start with verbs or outcomes
- Include proof/urgency

**Recommended Fix:**
```
Points:
- "Increase revenue per fan (not just units sold)"
- "Get fans buying at games, watch parties, sponsor locations"
- "Launch in 6-8 weeks with full design support"
- "Start with 100 kits, no long-term contract"
- "2026 pilot spots filling now"
```

**Why Better:**
- Outcome-led (increase revenue, get fans buying)
- Concrete actions
- Risk reversal (no long-term contract)
- Urgency (filling now)

---

### 7. FOOTER CTA

#### Current Copy
"Stop leaving revenue on the table. Make your apparel work 100+ times per year."

**Issues:**
- ✅ Actually pretty good!
- ⚠️ Minor: "100+ times per year" repeated throughout site

**Recommended Tweak:**
```
"Your fans wear your kit 100+ times a year. Start earning revenue every time."
```

**Why Better:**
- Reframes from "you're missing out" to "you have opportunity"
- Action-oriented (start earning)
- Positive framing

---

## B2B Best Practice Violations Summary

### 1. WORDINESS ❌

**Current State:**
- Hero subhead: 51 words (should be 20-30)
- Problem description: 68 words (should be 40-50)
- Category explanation: 44 words (should be 30)

**Impact:** Decision-makers scan, don't read. Long copy gets skipped.

**Fix:** Cut 30-40% of words. Use short sentences.

---

### 2. LACK OF URGENCY ❌

**Current Urgency Elements:**
- ✅ "Pilot spots for 2026 season filling fast" (good)
- ❌ Only ONE urgency element on entire site

**Missing:**
- No scarcity (limited spots)
- No FOMO (early movers advantage)
- No time pressure (deadlines)

**Fix:** Add urgency to Partnership, Risk Reversal, and Experience sections.

---

### 3. FEATURE-HEAVY INSTEAD OF OUTCOME-HEAVY ❌

**Current Feature Language:**
- "Location-aware commerce infrastructure"
- "Design collaboration and hands-on support"
- "NFC tags are permanent and wash-tested"

**Should Be Outcome Language:**
- "Earn revenue wherever fans wear your kit"
- "Launch in 6 weeks with full support"
- "Works for 3+ years without replacement"

**Impact:** Features don't motivate B2B buyers. Outcomes do.

---

### 4. TOO MANY NUMBERS ❌

**Current Stats Per Section:**
- Problem: 4 stats ($60, 100+, 80%, half)
- Risk Reversal: 3 stats (2.8×, 4.3×, 2-4×)
- Experience Types: Numbers in every benefit

**Best Practice:** Max 1-2 numbers per section for impact.

**Fix:** Pick the most compelling stat, remove others.

---

### 5. PASSIVE VOICE / WEAK VERBS ⚠️

**Examples:**
- "are permanent" → "last 3+ years"
- "unlocks offers" → "delivers revenue"
- "creates opportunities" → "generates income"

**Fix:** Use active, concrete verbs.

---

## Plain Language Audit

### Replace Corporate Jargon:

| ❌ Current | ✅ Plain Language |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Infrastructure" | "Revenue channel" |
| "Commerce opportunities" | "Ways to earn money" |
| "Activations" | "Offers" or "Sales" |
| "Optimize" | "Increase" |
| "Leverage" | "Use" |
| "Fundamental limitations" | "Why it doesn't work" |
| "Revenue optimization" | "Increase revenue per fan" |

---

## Scanning Optimization

### Current Scan Score: 6/10

**Issues:**
- Long paragraphs in Problem section
- Too many words per bullet point
- Not enough white space in category section

**Fixes:**
1. Break problem description into 2 short paragraphs
2. Limit bullets to 6-8 words max
3. Use more line breaks

**Example:**
```
BEFORE (hard to scan):
"Revenue optimization, not just kit production"

AFTER (scannable):
"Increase revenue per fan"
```
