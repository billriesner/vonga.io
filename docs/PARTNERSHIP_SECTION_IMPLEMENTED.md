---

## 📝 New Content

### Headline (Changed)
**Before:** "Built to Increase Revenue Per Fan"  
**After:** "How We Work Together"

**Why:**
- ✅ Clear purpose (about the process, not outcomes)
- ✅ No revenue repetition
- ✅ Bridges from experience section
- ✅ Partnership-focused

---

### Subhead (Completely Rewritten)
**Before:** "Traditional providers focus on manufacturing. We focus on helping you earn revenue 100+ times per year."

**After:** "From design to launch to ongoing optimization, we partner with you to create the fan experiences that drive engagement and revenue."

**Changes:**
- ❌ **Removed:** Negative comparison ("Traditional providers...")
- ❌ **Removed:** Transactional language ("100+ times per year")
- ✅ **Added:** Journey description (design → launch → optimize)
- ✅ **Added:** Partnership language ("partner with you")
- ✅ **Added:** Connection to experiences (previous section)

---

### Bullet Points (All 5 Rewritten)

#### 1. Collaborative Design
**Before:** "Increase revenue per fan (not just units sold)"  
**After:** "Collaborative design: Your brand, our platform"

**Pattern:** "[Benefit]: [Details]"  
**Message:** Co-creation, not transactional vendor

---

#### 2. Fast Launch (Adjusted per User)
**Before:** "Launch in 6-8 weeks with full design support"  
**After:** "Fast launch: As little as 6-8 weeks for standard programs"

**Adjustments:**
- ✅ "As little as" = Shows flexibility
- ✅ "standard programs" = Implies custom takes longer
- ✅ Sets expectations appropriately

**Message:** Fast time to value, with flexibility for complex needs

---

#### 3. Low-Risk Pilot (Adjusted per User)
**Before:** "Start with 100 kits, no long-term contract"  
**After:** "Low-risk pilot: Start with 300 kits, scale when ready"

**Adjustments:**
- ✅ Changed: 100 → 300 kits (per user's minimum)
- ✅ Added: "scale when ready" (flexibility)
- ✅ Removed: "no long-term contract" (implied in pilot)

**Message:** Reasonable minimum, low commitment, scale at your pace

---

#### 4. Continuous Improvement (NEW)
**Before:** "Get fans buying at games, watch parties, sponsor locations"  
**After:** "Continuous improvement: Optimize based on real fan data"

**Changes:**
- ❌ **Removed:** Repetitive capability list (covered in Experiences section)
- ✅ **Added:** Ongoing partnership emphasis
- ✅ **Added:** Data-driven optimization

**Message:** Not one-and-done, we optimize together

---

#### 5. Urgency with Benefit (Enhanced)
**Before:** "2026 pilot spots filling now"  
**After:** "Limited 2026 spots: Early partners lock in pricing"

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added clear benefit ("lock in pricing")
- ✅ More specific ("Limited 2026 spots" vs "filling now")
- ✅ Still creates urgency without pressure

**Message:** Act now, with tangible benefit

---

## 🎯 Strategic Improvements

### 1. Removes Repetition ✅
**Before:** "Revenue per fan" mentioned:
- Category section (stats panel)
- This section (headline)
- Form section (subhead)

**After:** This section focuses on **process**, not revenue
- Revenue mentioned in outcomes context only
- No repetition

---

### 2. Removes Negative Comparison ✅
**Before:** "Traditional providers focus on manufacturing..."

**After:** Positive framing throughout
- What we DO (collaborate, optimize, support)
- Not what others DON'T do
- Confident positioning

---

### 3. Bridges from Experiences ✅
**Previous section:** "Here's what you can create" (4 experience types)  
**This section:** "Here's how we make it happen together"  
**Natural flow** ✅

---

### 4. Journey-Based Structure ✅
**Bullets now follow a logical journey:**
1. **Design** (collaborative start)
2. **Launch** (fast execution)
3. **Pilot** (low-risk entry)
4. **Optimize** (ongoing partnership)
5. **Act now** (urgency with benefit)

**Before:** Mixed messages (outcomes, capabilities, logistics, urgency)  
**After:** Clear progression through partnership stages

---

### 5. Partnership, Not Vendor ✅
**Language throughout:**
- "Partner with you"
- "Collaborative design"
- "Continuous improvement"
- "Work together"

**Message:** Long-term relationship, not transactional vendor
