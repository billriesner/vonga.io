## ❌ Issues with Current Headline

### "Let's Explore If Vonga Is Right For Your Team"

**Problems:**
1. ✅ **Too tentative** - "Explore if" sounds uncertain
2. ✅ **Questions fit** - After proving stats and trust, why question fit?
3. ✅ **Lacks confidence** - Doesn't match the decisive tone we've built
4. ✅ **Weak CTA** - Not action-oriented

**Feels like:** A first-date conversation ("Let's see if we're compatible")
**Should feel like:** A business decision ("Let's get started")

---

## ❌ Issues with Current Subhead

### "Tell us about your team and we'll be in touch to discuss how Vonga can help you increase revenue per fan. Pilot spots for 2026 season filling fast."

**Problems:**
1. ✅ **Too wordy** - 28 words for what could be 12-15
2. ✅ **"Discuss how Vonga can help"** - We've already shown how
3. ✅ **Buries the urgency** - "Pilot spots filling fast" is at the end

**Good elements to keep:**
- ✅ "Tell us about your team" (clear action)
- ✅ "Pilot spots for 2026 filling fast" (urgency)

---

## ✅ What Works Well

### Next Steps Section:
- ✅ Clear 4-step process
- ✅ Specific timeline (15 min call, 6-8 weeks launch)
- ✅ Shows what they'll get (pilot plan, pricing, mockups)
- ✅ Reduces friction

**Keep this as-is.**
