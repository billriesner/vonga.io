# DIY Comparison Section - Removed

**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Action:** Removed DIY Comparison section from homepage  
**Reason:** Don't want to suggest DIY approaches to potential customers

---

## ✅ What Was Removed

**Section:** "Why Not QR Codes and a Loyalty App?"

**Content:**
- Showed DIY approaches (QR codes, loyalty apps, social media)
- Contrasted problems with DIY vs Vonga solutions
- Listed 4 limitation comparisons

---

## 🎯 Why Removed

### Strategic Reason
**Don't want to give teams ideas to DIY** - Showing QR codes and loyalty apps as alternatives might:
- Give teams ideas to build it themselves
- Suggest that DIY is a viable option
- Distract from Vonga's unique value

### Better Approach
**Focus on what Vonga enables, not what others lack**
- Show positive value creation (experiences)
- Don't mention DIY approaches
- Let differentiation come through capabilities shown

## 💡 Alternative Ways to Address Objections

Instead of showing "Why Not DIY?", we now address objections through:

### 1. Positive Differentiation
- "Apparel as gateway" (unique positioning)
- "Zero-party data" (competitive advantage)
- Experience types (what competitors can't do)

### 2. Trust Statements
- "No app required"
- "Team-controlled experiences"
- "Permanent, wash-tested"

### 3. Proof/Risk Reversal
- Industry data (2.8×, 4.3×)
- Proven model
- Low commitment pilot

- ✅ **Doesn't compare** to QR codes/loyalty apps
- ✅ **Focuses on value creation** (experiences)

**No negative comparisons. Only positive value.** ✅
