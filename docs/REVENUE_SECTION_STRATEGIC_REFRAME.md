# Revenue Section - Strategic Reframe

**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Based on:** User's strategic clarity about what Vonga really does

---

## 🎯 Core Strategic Insight

> "Our product transforms one-time purchases into an ongoing channel. This allows us to create unique, fan-centric experiences where **the apparel becomes the gateway**."

---

## 🔍 Current Problem with Section

### What We Have Now:
- 4 cards focused on **revenue types** (outcomes)
- Messaging: "Here are ways to make money"
- Cards: Location-Aware Commerce, Sponsor Revenue, Peak Moment, Year-Round Engagement

### What's Missing:
- ❌ Doesn't explain the **transformation** (one-time → ongoing channel)
- ❌ Doesn't emphasize **experiences** (what fans get)
- ❌ Doesn't show the **flow** (experiences → engagement → revenue)
- ❌ Doesn't highlight **apparel as gateway** (the key insight)
- ❌ Doesn't mention **zero-party data** advantage

---

## 💡 Key Insights from User

### 1. The Transformation
**Not:** "We sell smart apparel"  
**But:** "We transform one-time purchases into an ongoing channel"

### 2. Experiences Come First
**Not:** "Here's how to make revenue"  
**But:** "Here's what you can create for fans" (which drives engagement → revenue)

### 3. Apparel is the Gateway
**Not:** "Apparel with tech"  
**But:** "Apparel becomes the access point to experiences"

### 4. The Flow
Apparel (gateway) → Experiences (activation) → Engagement (behavior) → Revenue (outcome)

### 5. Zero-Party Data Advantage
- Track all activity on one platform
- No need to string together disparate data
- Huge advantage over social media, ticketing, retail data

       ↓
   EXPERIENCES ──┬── Geofenced
                 ├── Timebound
                 ├── Content

## 🎯 My Top Recommendation

- ✅ Clear path: Experience → Engagement → Revenue
- ✅ Maintains 4-card B2B layout
- ✅ Still outcome-focused (each card ends with revenue benefit)

**Enhanced with:**
- Section intro copy explaining "apparel as gateway"
- After cards: "Zero-party data advantage" callout

## 📝 Proposed New Section Copy

### Section Headline
**Option 1:** "Turn Apparel Into the Gateway to Fan Experiences"

**My pick:** Option 1 (clear transformation, includes "gateway")

---

### Section Subhead (NEW - Add This)

## 🔄 Key Messaging Shifts

### Before → After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Location-Aware Commerce" | "Geofenced Experiences" |

### 5. B2B Credibility ✅

## 🤔 Questions to Refine

3. **Revenue outcomes:** Add separate summary section, or keep in card benefits?
4. **Visual flow:** Add diagram showing transformation, or just text?
