## 💡 PRO TIPS

### While Building:

1. **Save frequently** - Canva auto-saves, but click "Save" manually too
2. **Duplicate pages** - Instead of starting fresh, duplicate similar scenes
3. **Use grids** - View → Show rulers/guides for alignment
4. **Preview often** - Click "Present" to see how it flows
5. **Get feedback** - Share with a colleague before finalizing

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

- ❌ Text too small (unreadable on mobile)
- ❌ Too many animations (feels gimmicky)
- ❌ Music too loud (should enhance, not overpower)
- ❌ Inconsistent colors (stick to brand palette)
- ❌ Rushing the first 5 seconds (most critical part!)

### If You Get Stuck:

- **Can't find right stock video?** Use Pexels or Unsplash (free, upload to Canva)
- **Mockup doesn't fit frame?** Use transparent background + resize
- **Animation too fast/slow?** Click animation → Adjust speed slider
- **Scene too long?** Trim in timeline (drag edge of page)

---

## ✅ FINAL DELIVERABLES

When complete, you should have:

1. [ ] **Primary video:** `vonga-demo-30s.mp4` (1920x1080, 16:9)

3. [ ] **Canva project saved** (for future edits)
4. [ ] **Video uploaded to website** (`/public/videos/demo-video.mp4`)
