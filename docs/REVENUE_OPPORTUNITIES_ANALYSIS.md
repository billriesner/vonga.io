# Revenue Opportunities Section - Analysis & Recommendations

**Current Title:** "Platform Capabilities"  
**Current Issue:** Over-emphasizes geofencing/location (first card, file name references)  
**Goal:** Show full breadth of capabilities without over-indexing on location

---

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### Content
- 5 capability cards
- Grid layout (3 columns)
- Icon + Title + Description + Examples + Benefit

### Current Order
1. **Location-Aware Commerce** ← Geofencing first (problem!)
2. Sponsor Revenue Platform
3. Repeat Commerce Channel
4. Event-Triggered Revenue
5. Premium Content Monetization

---

## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### 1. Over-Emphasis on Location/Geofencing
- ❌ **First card** = "Location-Aware Commerce"
- ❌ **File name** = "experience-types.ts" header says "Location-Aware Commerce Capabilities"
- ❌ **First position** = Gets most visual attention
- ❌ **First card description** = "Earn revenue wherever fans wear your kit" (very location-focused)

**Impact:** Visitors think geofencing is the main/only thing Vonga does

---

### 2. Layout Issues (B2B Perspective)
- ⚠️ **5 cards in 3-column grid** = Awkward (3 top, 2 bottom)
- ⚠️ **Not balanced** = Last row has empty space
- ⚠️ **Hard to prioritize** = All cards look equally important

**B2B preference:** Even grids (2×2, 3×2, 2×3) or clear hierarchy

---

### 3. Messaging Balance
**Current emphasis:**
- 🔴 Location: 40% (first card + file references)
- 🟡 Sponsorship: 20%
- 🟡 Commerce: 20%
- 🟡 Events: 10%
- 🟡 Content: 10%

**Should be:**
- 🟢 All capabilities: Equal or strategic emphasis
- 🟢 Revenue outcomes: Primary focus
- 🟢 Technology: Secondary (how it works, not what it is)

---

### 4. Card Content Quality

**Good:**
- ✅ Clear titles
- ✅ Specific examples
- ✅ Outcome benefits
- ✅ Scannable format

**Could improve:**
- ⚠️ Some benefits are vague ("every wearing = revenue opportunity")
- ⚠️ Examples could be more B2B/ROI focused
- ⚠️ Missing specific metrics where possible

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Option A: Reorder + Rename (Minimal Change)

**New order:**
1. **Repeat Commerce Channel** (ongoing revenue - core value)
2. **Sponsor Revenue Platform** (new revenue streams)
3. **Event-Triggered Revenue** (peak moment monetization)
4. **Premium Content Monetization** (retention/engagement)
5. **Location-Aware Commerce** (technology enabler) ← Move to last

**Rationale:**
- Lead with business outcomes (repeat revenue)
- Technology (location) becomes an enabler, not the product
- Sponsorship high (new revenue source)

---

### Option B: 4-Card Focus (Best for B2B)

**Keep only 4 cards for clean 2×2 grid:**
1. **Ongoing Revenue** (combines repeat commerce + content)
2. **Sponsor Monetization** (sponsor platform)
3. **Peak Moment Capture** (event-triggered)
4. **Location Intelligence** (combines geofencing + general location capability)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean 2×2 grid
- ✅ Higher-level capabilities (not feature list)
- ✅ Outcome-focused titles
- ✅ Better B2B aesthetic

---

### Option C: Outcome-First Reframe

**Change titles to outcomes, not features:**
1. **Increase Purchase Frequency** (was: Repeat Commerce)
   - Mechanism: Exclusive drops, VIP access
   - Location enables: Yes, but not the headline

2. **Add New Revenue Streams** (was: Sponsor Platform)
   - Mechanism: Verified visits, commission
   - Location enables: Yes

3. **Capture Peak Moments** (was: Event-Triggered)
   - Mechanism: In-game, championships
   - Location enables: Sometimes

4. **Build Ongoing Engagement** (was: Premium Content)
   - Mechanism: Behind-scenes, community
   - Location enables: Not necessarily

**Rationale:**
- Outcome = what buyer cares about
- Mechanism = how Vonga does it
- Location = one of many enablers
