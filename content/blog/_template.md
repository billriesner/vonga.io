## Start with a Hook

Open with something that grabs attention. A surprising stat, a common pain point, or a bold statement.

Example:
> "Most athletic programs waste 40% of their sponsorship budget on measurement they can't prove."

## Problem Section

Identify the core problem your reader faces.

### Use Subheadings for Structure

Break your content into scannable sections. Most people skim before reading.

**Key points:**
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences)
- Bold important concepts
- Use examples and stories

## Solution Section

Now provide the answer. How do they solve this problem?

### Real-World Example

Use specific examples:

> "When Ohio State implemented NFC-enabled merchandise, tap-through rates jumped to 47%—15x higher than traditional QR codes."

Specific numbers and real scenarios are more credible than generic advice.

## Make It Actionable

Give readers something they can do **today**.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **First action** - Explain what to do and why
2. **Second action** - Be specific and practical
3. **Third action** - Give a concrete next step

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

People love learning what NOT to do:

- ❌ Mistake #1: Why it's bad
- ❌ Mistake #2: What happens if you do this
- ✅ Instead: What to do correctly

## Visual Elements

### Using Images

*Caption: Add context for your images*

### Tables Work Great for Comparisons

| Traditional Approach | Modern Approach |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Manual tracking | Automated measurement |
| Estimated impressions | Verified engagement |
| Quarterly reports | Real-time dashboards |

### Pull Quotes Stand Out

> "The best sponsorship measurement is invisible to fans but crystal clear to sponsors."

## The Bottom Line

End with a clear summary:
- What's the main takeaway?
- What should they remember?
- What's their next step?

Keep it punchy and actionable.
