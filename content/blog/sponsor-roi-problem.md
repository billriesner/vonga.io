## The Uncomfortable Truth About Sponsor Renewals

Let's talk about the conversation nobody wants to have.

You're sitting across from a sponsor—maybe it's a regional bank, a car dealership, or a local healthcare system. They've been with your program for three years. Now they want to know: **"What did we actually get for our money?"**

You pull out the usual stats:
- Logo impressions (estimated from attendance)
- Social media reach (mostly organic, hard to attribute)
- Banner placement at 5 home games
- "Brand awareness" (whatever that means)

The sponsor nods politely. Then they tell you they're "re-evaluating their marketing budget."

Translation: **They don't believe your numbers.**

And honestly? They shouldn't.

## Why Traditional Measurement Fails

Here's the problem most athletic programs face:

### 1. **You're Counting Eyeballs, Not Actions**

Traditional sponsorship metrics focus on **impressions**—how many people *might* have seen a logo. But impressions don't pay bills.

Sponsors care about:
- Did anyone click through to their website?
- Did anyone use their promo code?
- Did awareness translate to actual customer behavior?

**The gap:** You're measuring potential reach. They want actual outcomes.

### 2. **Attribution Is Impossible**

A fan sees your sponsor's logo at a game. Two weeks later, they visit that sponsor's business. Did the sponsorship work?

Maybe. Or maybe they saw a TV ad. Or drove past a billboard. Or got a recommendation from a friend.

**Without attribution, you're just guessing.**

### 3. **You're Competing Against Digital Marketing**

Your sponsor's marketing team isn't comparing you to other sports programs. They're comparing you to:
- Google Ads (instant metrics, clear ROI)
- Facebook targeting (demographic precision)
- Email campaigns (open rates, click-through, conversions)

Traditional sports sponsorship? It's a black box.

## The Budget Reality

Here's what this means in practice:

Most athletic programs spend money on **two separate things**:

1. **Merchandise** → Fans buy it, you make margin, everyone's happy
2. **Engagement platforms** → Apps, social campaigns, "interactive experiences"

Both cost money. Both require management. And they barely talk to each other.

Meanwhile, sponsors are asking: *"Can you prove our logo placement drove behavior?"*

And you're stuck saying: *"Well, we had great engagement at the game..."*

**That's not an answer. That's a hope.**

## What Actually Works

The solution isn't better measurement of the *same old tactics*. It's **merging value creation with measurement**.

Here's what that looks like:

### Real Example: Ohio State Women's Basketball (Hypothetical)

Instead of:
- Selling jerseys ($45, no data)
- Plus paying for a separate engagement app ($15k/season)
- Plus hoping sponsors believe impression counts

They could:
- Sell **NFC-enabled jerseys** ($48, with tech embedded)
- Fans tap to unlock content, deals, and sponsor offers
- Every tap is tracked, attributed, and reportable

**The result:**
- Merchandise revenue: ✅ (same or better)
- Fan engagement: ✅ (measurable, repeatable)
- Sponsor proof: ✅ (real-time dashboard of actual interactions)

**The difference:** Instead of paying twice (merch + engagement), you build it into one. And sponsors finally get the data they've been asking for.

## The Three Metrics That Actually Matter

If you're rebuilding your sponsor measurement strategy, focus on these:

### 1. **Tap-Through Rate**
How many people who own your merchandise actually engage with sponsor content?

- **Good:** 30-40%
- **Great:** 50-60%
- **Industry average (QR codes):** 2-3%

### 2. **Conversion Rate**
Of those who engage, how many take a sponsor-desired action?
- Redeeming a promo code
- Visiting a landing page
- Signing up for an offer

This is the number sponsors *actually care about*.

### 3. **Lifetime Engagement Value**
How many times does a single fan re-engage over a season?

If a fan taps once, that's nice. If they tap 8 times across different games? **That's a platform.**

## Why This Matters Now

Sponsorship budgets aren't shrinking—they're **getting more scrutinized**.

CMOs at major brands are under pressure to prove every dollar spent. If you can't show real ROI, you're not competing with other athletic programs.

**You're competing with Instagram ads.**

And Instagram has a dashboard.

## The Bottom Line

The sponsor ROI problem isn't about better reporting of old tactics. It's about **building measurement into the experience itself**.

If your merchandise, your engagement, and your sponsor value are three separate things, you'll always struggle to connect the dots.

But if you merge them—if the thing fans *want to buy* is also the thing that *proves sponsor value*—you've solved the problem.

That's not theory. It's how modern marketing works.

The question is: **Will you wait for sponsors to demand it, or build it before they ask?**

## What You Can Do Right Now

1. **Audit your current sponsor measurement** → What are you actually tracking? What can you prove?
2. **Ask your sponsors what they wish they knew** → Don't assume. Get specific feedback.
3. **Look for ways to merge value and measurement** → Can your merch do more than just look good?

The teams that figure this out early will have a huge advantage in the next round of renewals.
