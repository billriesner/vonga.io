            <p>The teams closing bigger sponsor deals aren't just selling better. They're selling with data. Vonga turns fan intelligence from your physical merch program into verifiable engagement proof — and that proof commands a premium.</p>

                <div class="card text-center">
                    <h4>Sponsor Deals Priced on Impressions</h4>
                    <p>When all you can offer is estimated reach and logo placement, you're competing in a market where every team has roughly the same pitch. Impressions are a commodity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card text-center">
                    <h4>Renewals Based on Relationships, Not Results</h4>
                    <p>A sponsor renews because their sales rep likes your VP of Partnerships — not because they can prove ROI. That's a fragile basis for a revenue line. Relationships change. Data doesn't.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card text-center">
                    <h4>Merch Revenue Is Table Stakes</h4>
                    <p>Every team sells jerseys and hats. The teams that build long-term revenue advantages are the ones that extract more value from those physical touchpoints than the items themselves generate.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">How Vonga Drives Revenue</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">The revenue impact of fan intelligence compounds over time. First-party fan data becomes more valuable every season it accumulates.</p>

            <div class="grid grid-2">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Sponsor Deal Premiums</h3>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Sponsors are skeptical of impressions-based pricing because they can't verify it. They negotiate hard because they have no proof your activation delivered.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);"><strong>With Vonga:</strong> You walk into negotiations with a sponsor portal showing verified fan engagement from their previous season's activation. Sponsors who can see real engagement data close at 15–30% higher deal values than those presented with estimated impressions.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);"><strong>The revenue math:</strong> On a $100,000 sponsor portfolio, a 20% lift on renewals is $20,000. That's a meaningful portion of your annual platform cost — recovered from the first renewal cycle.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Renewal Rate Protection</h3>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Sponsors who can't prove ROI cancel or downgrade. Budget holders who can't justify the spend to their CFO don't renew.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);"><strong>With Vonga:</strong> Sponsors with access to their own engagement portal can prove value internally. Their budget justification is the data, not their account manager's relationship with you. Renewals become defensible on both sides.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);"><strong>The revenue math:</strong> Protecting one mid-tier sponsor renewal ($25,000–$50,000) more than covers the platform cost for the year.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Fan Database as a Sales Asset</h3>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Prospective sponsors ask "who is your audience?" and you answer with ticket buyer demographics — which misses everyone who wears your brand but doesn't have season tickets.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);"><strong>With Vonga:</strong> Your fan database includes profiles built from physical engagement — people who wear your brand everywhere they go. That audience profile is broader, more authentic, and more valuable than ticket-scan demographics alone.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);"><strong>The revenue math:</strong> A richer audience profile supports higher CPM equivalents on sponsor package pricing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Campaign Performance Optimization</h3>
                    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> You're running fan campaigns but don't know which messages, content types, or timing drives real engagement. You're spending on instinct.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);"><strong>With Vonga:</strong> A/B testing on tap experiences tells you what content drives action. Campaign analytics show which fan segments respond to which offers. Every dollar spent on fan campaigns gets more efficient as the data accumulates.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);"><strong>The revenue math:</strong> Better-performing campaigns drive more ticket conversions, offer redemptions, and fan spend — on the same marketing budget.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Data Advantage Compounds</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">The first season builds the foundation. Every season after, the fan database grows richer and the revenue advantage widens.</p>

            <div class="steps">

                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <h3>Season 1</h3>
                    <p>First fan profiles build from physical touchpoints. Sponsors get their first verifiable engagement reports. A/B test data begins accumulating. Renewal conversations shift.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <div class="step-number">2</div>
                    <h3>Season 2</h3>
                    <p>Fan database grows. Behavioral segments become more refined. Repeat tappers identified. Sponsor renewals now supported by year-over-year engagement data. Premium deal pricing becomes defensible.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <div class="step-number">3</div>
                    <h3>Season 3+</h3>
                    <p>Fan intelligence is a structural organizational asset. New sponsor pitches include multi-season fan data. Fan segments drive targeted campaigns. Competitors who started later can't close the gap.</p>

                    <h3>Tiered Sponsor Packages</h3>
                    <p>Build premium sponsor packages that include exclusive portal access, fan segment targeting, and campaign co-creation. Data-backed packages command higher prices than logo placements alone.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Fan Segment Targeting Premiums</h3>
                    <p>Offer sponsors the ability to target specific fan segments — your most engaged fans, fans in a specific geographic region, fans who've tapped sponsor content before. Targeting premiums are standard in digital. Now you can offer them for physical activations.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Multi-Year Data Contracts</h3>
                    <p>Sponsors who see two seasons of engagement data are easier to lock into multi-year deals. Longer contracts at higher values — the revenue combination that makes the biggest impact on your forecast.</p>

                    <p>Fan data opens sponsor conversations with categories that previously couldn't justify sports partnerships: direct-to-consumer brands who need engagement proof, regional brands targeting specific geographic fan clusters, and performance marketers who think in conversion metrics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Fan Campaign Monetization</h3>
                    <p>Fan engagement campaigns generate data that informs every aspect of your revenue program — ticket campaigns, merchandise promotions, concession upsells. The fan intelligence pays dividends across every revenue line.</p>
