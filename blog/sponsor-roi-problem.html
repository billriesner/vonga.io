            <h2>The Uncomfortable Truth About Sponsor Renewals</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s talk about the conversation nobody wants to have.</p>
<p>You&#39;re sitting across from a sponsor—maybe it&#39;s a regional bank, a car dealership, or a local healthcare system. They&#39;ve been with your program for three years. Now they want to know: <strong>&quot;What did we actually get for our money?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>You pull out the usual stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo impressions (estimated from attendance)</li>
<li>Social media reach (mostly organic, hard to attribute)</li>
<li>Banner placement at 5 home games</li>
<li>&quot;Brand awareness&quot; (whatever that means)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sponsor nods politely. Then they tell you they&#39;re &quot;re-evaluating their marketing budget.&quot;</p>
<p>Translation: <strong>They don&#39;t believe your numbers.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? They shouldn&#39;t.</p>
<h2>Why Traditional Measurement Fails</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s the problem most athletic programs face:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>You&#39;re Counting Eyeballs, Not Actions</strong></h3>
<p>Traditional sponsorship metrics focus on <strong>impressions</strong>—how many people <em>might</em> have seen a logo. But impressions don&#39;t pay bills.</p>
<p>Sponsors care about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did anyone click through to their website?</li>
<li>Did anyone use their promo code?</li>
<li>Did awareness translate to actual customer behavior?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The gap:</strong> You&#39;re measuring potential reach. They want actual outcomes.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Attribution Is Impossible</strong></h3>
<p>A fan sees your sponsor&#39;s logo at a game. Two weeks later, they visit that sponsor&#39;s business. Did the sponsorship work?</p>
<p>Maybe. Or maybe they saw a TV ad. Or drove past a billboard. Or got a recommendation from a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Without attribution, you&#39;re just guessing.</strong></p>
<h3>3. <strong>You&#39;re Competing Against Digital Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Your sponsor&#39;s marketing team isn&#39;t comparing you to other sports programs. They&#39;re comparing you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Ads (instant metrics, clear ROI)</li>
<li>Facebook targeting (demographic precision)</li>
<li>Email campaigns (open rates, click-through, conversions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional sports sponsorship? It&#39;s a black box.</p>
<h2>The Budget Reality</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s what this means in practice:</p>
<p>Most athletic programs spend money on <strong>two separate things</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Merchandise</strong> → Fans buy it, you make margin, everyone&#39;s happy</li>
<li><strong>Engagement platforms</strong> → Apps, social campaigns, &quot;interactive experiences&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Both cost money. Both require management. And they barely talk to each other.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sponsors are asking: <em>&quot;Can you prove our logo placement drove behavior?&quot;</em></p>
<p>And you&#39;re stuck saying: <em>&quot;Well, we had great engagement at the game...&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>That&#39;s not an answer. That&#39;s a hope.</strong></p>
<h2>What Actually Works</h2>
<p>The solution isn&#39;t better measurement of the <em>same old tactics</em>. It&#39;s <strong>merging value creation with measurement</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what that looks like:</p>
<h3>Real Example: Ohio State Women&#39;s Basketball (Hypothetical)</h3>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selling jerseys ($45, no data)</li>
<li>Plus paying for a separate engagement app ($15k/season)</li>
<li>Plus hoping sponsors believe impression counts</li>
</ul>
<p>They could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell <strong>NFC-enabled jerseys</strong> ($48, with tech embedded)</li>
<li>Fans tap to unlock content, deals, and sponsor offers</li>
<li>Every tap is tracked, attributed, and reportable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The result:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Merchandise revenue: ✅ (same or better)</li>
<li>Fan engagement: ✅ (measurable, repeatable)</li>
<li>Sponsor proof: ✅ (real-time dashboard of actual interactions)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The difference:</strong> Instead of paying twice (merch + engagement), you build it into one. And sponsors finally get the data they&#39;ve been asking for.</p>
<h2>The Three Metrics That Actually Matter</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re rebuilding your sponsor measurement strategy, focus on these:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Tap-Through Rate</strong></h3>
<p>How many people who own your merchandise actually engage with sponsor content?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> 30-40%</li>
<li><strong>Great:</strong> 50-60%</li>
<li><strong>Industry average (QR codes):</strong> 2-3%</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Conversion Rate</strong></h3>
<p>Of those who engage, how many take a sponsor-desired action?</p>
<ul>
<li>Redeeming a promo code</li>
<li>Visiting a landing page</li>
<li>Signing up for an offer</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the number sponsors <em>actually care about</em>.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Lifetime Engagement Value</strong></h3>
<p>How many times does a single fan re-engage over a season?</p>
<p>If a fan taps once, that&#39;s nice. If they tap 8 times across different games? <strong>That&#39;s a platform.</strong></p>
<h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>
<p>Sponsorship budgets aren&#39;t shrinking—they&#39;re <strong>getting more scrutinized</strong>.</p>
<p>CMOs at major brands are under pressure to prove every dollar spent. If you can&#39;t show real ROI, you&#39;re not competing with other athletic programs.</p>
<p><strong>You&#39;re competing with Instagram ads.</strong></p>
<p>And Instagram has a dashboard.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>The sponsor ROI problem isn&#39;t about better reporting of old tactics. It&#39;s about <strong>building measurement into the experience itself</strong>.</p>
<p>If your merchandise, your engagement, and your sponsor value are three separate things, you&#39;ll always struggle to connect the dots.</p>
<p>But if you merge them—if the thing fans <em>want to buy</em> is also the thing that <em>proves sponsor value</em>—you&#39;ve solved the problem.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not theory. It&#39;s how modern marketing works.</p>
<p>The question is: <strong>Will you wait for sponsors to demand it, or build it before they ask?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>What You Can Do Right Now</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Audit your current sponsor measurement</strong> → What are you actually tracking? What can you prove?</li>
<li><strong>Ask your sponsors what they wish they knew</strong> → Don&#39;t assume. Get specific feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Look for ways to merge value and measurement</strong> → Can your merch do more than just look good?</li>
</ol>
<p>The teams that figure this out early will have a huge advantage in the next round of renewals.</p>
